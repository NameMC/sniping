# **Introduction**

Around a year ago I made a [Minecraft sniping guide](https://github.com/NameMC/BASIC-SNIPING-GUIDE). Considering the vast changes that have happened in the past year, I believe a revised version was necessary. I strongly advise you do not waste your time reading the older guide——if you were considering doing so——as it's very outdated. This guide (the one you're reading!) contains relevant information regarding the current state of sniping and how to obtain usernames through sniping. Unlike my previous guide, I intend for this one to be much more concise, and I will not include a glossary because it's too time consuming to make. I doubt anyone greatly benefited from that section either, so an updated version will not be made. If you have any questions, they should be taken to the [3NAME Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3name-community-609961212058271755) or the [McSniperGO Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mcsnipergo-734794891258757160).
