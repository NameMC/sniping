# **Introduction**

Around a year ago I made a [Minecraft sniping guide](https://github.com/NameMC/BASIC-SNIPING-GUIDE). Considering the vast changes that have happened in the past year, I believed a revised version was necessary. This guide contains relevant information regarding the current state of sniping and how to obtain usernames through sniping. Unlike my previous guide, I intend for this one to be much more concise, and I will not include a glossary because it's too time consuming to make. I doubt anyone greatly benefited from that section either, so an updated version will not be made. If you have any questions, they should be taken to the [3NAME Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3name-community-609961212058271755) or the [McSniperGO Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mcsnipergo-734794891258757160).
